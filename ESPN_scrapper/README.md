## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Configuration

1.  **Download ChromeDriver**: Download the correct version of ChromeDriver for your operating system and Chrome browser version.
2.  **Update the Script**: Open the Python script and update the `CHROME_DRIVER_PATH` variable with the absolute path to the `chromedriver.exe` file you just downloaded.

    ```python
    # update this with the location of your chromedriver
    CHROME_DRIVER_PATH = r"C:\path\to\your\chromedriver-win64\chromedriver.exe"
    ```

3.  **Set the URL**: You can change the `URL` variable to the ball-by-ball commentary page of any other match you wish to scrape.

1.  Make sure you have completed the setup steps above.
2.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
